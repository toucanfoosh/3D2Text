Fun little web project to convert 3D models to topological text

Made by Daniel Wu

#### Known issues:

- Models weirdly strech and squash when rotating (probably an aspect ratio issue)
- Laggy with higher dimensions or larger models (need to optimize the math more)
- Weird rotation on the models some times (could introduce a vertical rotation slider)
- Can "see through" models, need to fix my depth-rendering
